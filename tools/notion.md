# Notion best practices 
Notion is used primarily for writing initial ideas.
- describe the project
- list of bullet points that can be features, plans, sources, etc
- usually we use notion for the initial exploration and doc part

Each project has its page
- each page has sections (toggle headers or subpages)
- each should be scanable (able to read it in a few minutes)
