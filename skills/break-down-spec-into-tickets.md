# Break down spec into tickets
This only used if a spec is too large.
Then, it's better to break it down into progressive tickets.
From most fundamental to more advanced.
Order tickets by what needs to come first and what needs to come later

Each ticket should have:
- title
- short description (2-3 sentences)
- acceptance criteria
- high-level plan
- affected components (optional)
- decisions (optional)
