# Refine project idea
Project is not well defined. We have a general idea of what we want, but it's very vague. 
Have a convo, discuss different ideas, tradeoffs, potential solutions, think of the user experience, problem being solved, etc.

# Output:
- project description (just a couple of paragraphs)
