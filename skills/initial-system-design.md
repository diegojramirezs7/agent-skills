## System design
Idea for the project is fairly clear. 
Now, how do we make this happen?

High level plan:
- architecture
- data model
- backend components
- how does the frontend look like
- scale
- particular implementation decisions?
- MVP (what do focus on first vs later)

## Output:
- system design still loose and open to change
- good enough to start building
